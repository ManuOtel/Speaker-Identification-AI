# Speaker Identification AI

This repository contains the code for a university project based on developing a Speaker Identification AI using very limited data. The main target was to train a simple CNN for recognising the speaker in each data sample. The data come from the podcast 'Her GÃ¥r Det Godt', and the system was designed to identify one or both hosts when they are speaking, based on 5 second samples. 

The project was conducted at the University of Southern Denmark, for the Deep Neural Networks course.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 1.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManuOtel/Voice-Recognition-AI
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before starting the training/testing make sure to extract the data set from the .rar archive inside ./dataset folder. 

 - Training script:
```bash
cd src
python train.py
```

 - Testing script:
```bash
cd src
python test.py
```
